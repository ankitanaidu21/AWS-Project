Connect EC2 to RDS Aurora

Goal: To make an RDS connection through MySQL CLI, which is used for general database management/operation.

	1. Launch an EC2 instance using the custom AMI(created in compute setup) in the public subnet of your VPC. Make sure it has a public IP.
	2. Update the RDS Aurora security group to allow connections from the EC2 instance (use the EC2 security group as a source).
	3. SSH into the EC2 instance using your key.
	4. Connect to the RDS Aurora using the MySQL client (already installed).Find commands in commands.md file.
	5. Run MySQL query:
		show databases;
		use immersionday;
		show tables;
		select * from address;
	6. You should see sample data from the address table.
